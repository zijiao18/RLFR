#Introduction
This repository contains a collections of ROS nodes which implement various reinforcment learning methods for robotic contol tasks. Reinforcment learning is a general framework that enables agent to autonomously solve control tasks through trials and errors. It works best in stationary environments, such as games. However, applying reinforcment learing to robotics requires taking consideration of practical factor, e.g. control delay, uncertainties in sensing and motion, and resource limits. To this end, the reinforcement learning methods hosted in the repository learns control policies in cononical robotic simulators (i.e., Gazebo) which provides realistically simulation for motion and sensing of robots.
